# DeletePagePermanently
MediaWiki doesn’t allow to permanently delete a page but sysops can “delete” a page such that it could still be restored. This is a deliberate design feature. However there are situations where you need to really delete a page and all its revisions from a database, especially in shared web hosting where performance and database size are generally limited. It was the first extension to do the job.
The first release was designed for MediaWiki 1.13 in 2008, originally for a punctual need. The extension was further enhanced by the open-source community and translated in 11 languages.
